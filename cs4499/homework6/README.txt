Compiling Instructions

Gcc:
    gcc -std=c++17 *.cpp -o homework6

Cmake on Unix or mingw or cygwin:
    cmake .
    make

Cmake on windows:
    cmake .
    <open generated solution in visual studio to build and run>

Executables:

Both homework6 and homework6.exe were compiled on a x86-64 Ubuntu GNU/Linux machine. homework6 is targeted towards
64-bit linux systems. homework6.exe is targeted towards 64-bit Windows systems but has not been tested on Windows.
I cannot guarantee it will work.
